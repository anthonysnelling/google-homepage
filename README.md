This is a project for practice with CSS and HTML. I recreated the Google main page and it is responsive as well.
 It isn't exactly one to one but I was mostly seeing if I could recreate it without inspecting their code too much.

You can see it live at https://anthonysnelling.github.io/google-homepage/index.html
